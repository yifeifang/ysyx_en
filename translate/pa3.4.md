[#](#Simple-file-system) simple file system
===================

To implement a complete batch system, we need to provide multiple programs to the system. We have previously stored our programs as files on the ramdisk, but if the number of programs increases, we need to know the position (offset) of certain program in ramdisk. Our ramdisk already provides a read/write interface, which makes it easy to access the contents of a certain location, which doesn't seem to be much of a problem for Nanos-lite; on the other hand, user programs need to process data, and the data they process may be organized into files, so how does the user program know where the files are located on the ramdisk? Moreover, files are dynamically added and deleted without the user program's knowledge. This means that it is not feasible to make the ramdisk read/write interface directly available to the user program. The operating system needs to provide the user program with a higher level of abstraction over the storage medium driver, that is, the file.

A file is essentially a sequence of bytes, with some additional attributes. Here, we will discuss files in the normal sense. Thus, those additional attributes maintain a mapping of files to ramdisk storage locations. In order to manage these mappings and provide an interface to the upper layers for file operations, we need to implement a file system in Nanos-lite.

Don't be intimidated by the word "file system", our needs for a file system are not that complex, so we can define a simple file system sfs (Simple File System):

*   The size of each file is fixed
*   Writing a file is not allowed to exceed the size of the original file
*   The number of files is fixed, no new files can be created
*   No directories

Since the number and size of files is fixed, it is natural to fix each file in a separate location on the ramdisk. These simplifications make the file system much less difficult to implement. Of course, real filesystems are much more complex than sfs.

Let's assume that the files are stored one by one from the very beginning of the ramdisk.

    0
    +-------------+---------+----------+-----------+--
    |    file0    |  file1  |  ......  |   filen   |
    +-------------+---------+----------+-----------+--
     \           / \       /            \         /
      +  size0  +   +size1+              + sizen +
    

In order to keep track of the names and sizes of the files in the ramdisk, we also need a "file list". Nanos-lite's Makefile already provides a script to maintain this information, so make the following changes to `nanos-lite/Makefile`.

    --- nanos-lite/Makefile
    +++ nanos-lite/Makefile
    @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
    -#HAS_NAVY = 1
    +HAS_NAVY = 1
     RAMDISK_FILE = build/ramdisk.img
    

Then running `make ARCH=$ISA-nemu update` will automatically compile the program in Navy, and assemble everything in the `navy-apps/fsimg/` directory into a ramdisk image `navy-apps/build/ramdisk.img`, and generate a file list `navy-apps/build/ramdisk.h` for the ramdisk image, which Nanos-lite's `Makefile` will link to the project via a soft link.

#### Remember to update the image file

If you have modified the contents of Navy, please remember to update the image file with the above command.

The "file list" is actually an array, and each element of the array is a structure.

    typedef struct {
      char *name;         // File name
      size_t size;        // File size
      size_t disk_offset;  // File offset in ramdisk
    } Finfo;
    

In sfs, all three pieces of information are fixed. The filenames are not as we normally use them: since sfs does not have directories, we consider the directory separator `/` to be part of the filename, e.g., `/bin/hello` is a full filename. This approach also implies a hierarchy of directories, which is simple and effective when the number of files is small.

With this information, the most basic file reading and writing operations can be realized:

    size_t read(const char *filename, void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t write(const char *filename, const void *buf, size_t len);
    

In real operating systems, however, this direct use of file names as parameters for read and write operations has its drawbacks. For example, when browsing a file with the `less` tool.

    cat file | less
    

The `cat` tool wants to write the contents of the file to the `less` tool's standard input, but we can't identify the `less` tool's standard input with the name of the file! In fact, there are quite a few "unnamed" files in the operating system. In order to manage them in a uniform way, we would like to represent the file by a number, which is a file descriptor. A file descriptor corresponds to a file that is being opened, and it is up to the operating system to maintain the mapping of file descriptors to specific files. It is natural to open a file with the `open()` system call, which returns the corresponding file descriptor.

    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
    

In Nanos-lite, since the number of files in the sfs is fixed, we can simply return the subscripts of the file list to the user program as the file descriptors of the corresponding files. From now on, all file operations identify files by their file descriptors.

    size_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t len);
    int close(int fd);
    

Also, we don't want to have to start from scratch every time we read or write to a file. So we need to introduce an offset attribute, `open_offset`, for each open file to keep track of where the file operation is currently taking place. Each time a file is read or written, the offset is advanced by a certain number of bytes.

#### File Offsets and User Programs

In fact, in a real operating system, maintaining offsets in a file record table can cause a user program to fail to perform certain functions. Explaining this requires some knowledge beyond the scope of this course, so we won't go into it here. You can think about this in your operating systems course.

Since Nanos-lite is a stripped-down version of the operating system, the above problem will not occur for a while, but for simplicity of implementation, we will maintain the offsets in a file record table.

The offsets can be adjusted by the `lseek()` system call, which allows you to read or write anywhere in the file: `lseek()`:

    size_t lseek(int fd, size_t offset, int whence);
    

In order to facilitate standard input and output for user programs, the operating system has prepared three default file descriptors:

    #define FD_STDIN 0
    #define FD_STDOUT 1
    #define FD_STDERR 2
    

They correspond to standard input `stdin`, standard output `stdout` and standard error `stderr`. We often use printf, which will eventually call `write(FD_STDOUT, buf, len)` for output, and scanf, which will call `read(FD_STDIN, buf, len)` for read.

The `file_table` defined in `nanos-lite/src/fs.c` will contain `nanos-lite/src/files.h`, which will be preceded by placeholder entries for three special files: `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, which are there to ensure that the sfs is in line with the agreed-upon standard. For example, the file descriptor for `stdout` is `1` by convention, and by adding the three placeholder entries, the `1` subscript in the file record table will not be assigned to any other common file.

Based on the above information, we can implement the following file operations in the file system:

    int fs_open(const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
    size_t fs_read(int fd, void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t fs_write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t fs_lseek(int fd, size_t offset, int whence);
    int fs_close(int fd);
    

These file operations are actually implementations of the corresponding system calls in the kernel. You can find out what they do via `man`, for example

    man 2 open
    

where `2` means consulting the manual page associated with the system call. Implement these file operations with the following in mind:

*   Since every file in sfs is fixed and no new files are created, "`fs_open()` did not find the file indicated by `pathname`" is an exception, and you need to terminate the program with an assertion.
*   To simplify the implementation, we allow all user programs to read and write to all existing files, so that in the future, we can ignore `flags` and `mode` when implementing `fs_open()`.
*   Use `ramdisk_read()` and `ramdisk_write()` to actually read and write files.
*   Since the size of the file is fixed, when implementing `fs_read()`, `fs_write()` and `fs_lseek()`, be careful that the offsets do not cross the file boundaries.
*   Except for writing to `stdout` and `stderr` (using `putch()` to output to the serial port), the rest of the operations on the three special files `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` can be ignored.
*   Since sfs does not maintain the status of open files, `fs_close()` can simply return `0`, indicating that the close was always successful.

Finally, you need to add system calls to Nanos-lite and Navy's libos to invoke the appropriate file operations.

#### Let loader use files

Previously, we had the loader call `ramdisk_read()` directly to load the user program. As the number of files in the ramdisk grows, this approach is no longer appropriate, and we need to give the loader the benefit of the filesystem in the first place.

You need to implement `fs_open()`, `fs_read()` and `fs_close()`, so that you can specify the loaded program in the loader with a filename, e.g. "/bin/hello".

Once this is implemented, changing the user program in the future will only require changing the filename passed to the `naive_uload()` function.

#### Implementing a complete file system

Implement `fs_write()` and `fs_lseek()`, then run the test program `navy-apps/tests/file-test`. In order to compile it, you need to add it to the `TESTS` variable of `navy-apps/Makefile`, so that it will eventually be included in the ramdisk image. This test program is used to perform some simple file reading, writing and positioning operations. If your implementation is correct, you will see the program output the `PASS!!!` message.

#### Remember to update the app list

If you wish to add an application to the image, please remember to add it to the list of applications in the Makefile above.

#### Support strace for sfs

Due to the feature of sfs, opening the same file will always return the same file descriptor. This means that we can translate the file descriptors in strace directly into filenames to get a more readable trace. Try to implement this feature, it will help you to use strace in the future.

[#](#Everything-is-a-file) Everything is a file
-----------------

The IOEs in AM show us what a program needs to do with input and output. So on Nanos-lite, what does a user program do if it wants to access a device? One of the most straightforward ways to do this is to have the operating system provide a separate system call for each device, which allows the user program to access the functionality directly through these system calls. However, there are a number of problems with this approach:

*   First of all, there are various types of devices, and their functions are even more numerous, to implement system calls for each of them to provide interfaces to the user program, itself already lacks feasibility.
*   In addition, since the functions of devices vary greatly, if the interfaces provided are not uniform, the interaction between programs and devices becomes difficult. Therefore, we need a way to abstract the functions of devices and provide a unified interface to user programs.

As we mentioned before, the essence of a file is a sequence of bytes. In fact, computer systems are full of byte sequences (what would a computer do with an unordered collection of bytes?) , and we can easily give many examples: we can use bytes in a file, and we can use bytes in a file in a file. , we can easily give many examples.

*   Memory is byte-addressed, which is naturally a sequence of bytes, so our previous use of ramdisk as a sequence of bytes is even more obvious
*   A pipe (`|` in shell commands) is a first-in-first-out sequence of bytes, which is essentially a queue buffer in memory
*   The disk can also be viewed as a byte sequence: we can number each byte on the disk, for example, the nth byte of the xth pillar, the yth head, the zth sector, all the bytes on the disk in accordance with the number of the size of the arrangement, you get a sequence of bytes
*   Network socket is also a kind of byte sequence, it has a buffer, responsible for storing the received network packets, the upper layer application sees the contents of the socket as a byte sequence, and handles them through some special file operations. We introduced DiffTest in PA2, if you RTFSC, you will find that the `qemu-diff` is to communicate with QEMU through socket, and the way to manipulate the socket is `fgetc()` and `fputc()`
*   Some information about the operating system can be exposed to the user as a sequence of bytes, such as CPU configuration information
*   Special features provided by the operating system, such as the random number generator, can also be viewed as an infinitely long sequence of bytes
*   Even some non-storage types of hardware can be viewed as sequences of bytes: the encoding of the keys we hit in sequence on a keyboard forms a sequence of bytes, and the content of each pixel on a display can be viewed as a sequence of bytes in the order in which it is displayed...

Since a file is a sequence of bytes, it's only natural that all these various sequences of bytes should be considered files. Unix does this, hence the phrase "everything is a file". The most intuitive benefit of this approach is that it provides a uniform interface to different things: we can use the file interface to manipulate everything on the computer without having to make detailed distinctions: for example, the `ramdisk` rule in `navy-apps/Makefile` pipes the input and output of various shell utilities to produce a file list

    wc -c $(FSIMG_FILES) | grep -v 'total$$' | sed -e 's+ ./fsimg+ +' |
      awk -v sum=0 '{print "\x7b\x22" $$2 "\x22\x2c " $$1 "\x2c " sum "\x7d\x2c";sum += $$1}' >> $(RAMDISK_H)
    

Viewing the contents of a disk in hexadecimal format

    head -c 512 /dev/sda | hd
    

查看CPU是否有Spectre漏洞Check CPU for Spectre vulnerabilities

    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'spectre'
    

Even the "Little Star" sample audio we provided in PA2 was violently spliced together through simple file manipulation.

    cat Do.ogg Do.ogg So.ogg So.ogg La.ogg La.ogg So.ogg > little-star.ogg
    

As well as

    #include "/dev/urandom"
    

The contents of the random device will be included in the source file: since the random device is an infinite sequence of bytes, submitting the source file of a program containing the above contents will crash some Online Judge platforms that do not have strong detection capabilities.

The "everything is a file" abstraction makes it easy to do things with standard tools that are not easy to do on Windows, and this is part of the Unix philosophy: each program uses text files as input and output, which makes it easy for programs to work together. GNU/Linux inherits from Unix, and naturally inherits this excellent feature. In order to provide a uniform abstraction for user programs, Nanos-lite also attempts to abstract IOEs to files.

### [#](#Virtual-file-system) Virtual file system

In order to realize the idea that everything is a file, we need to extend our previous implementation of file operations: not only do we need to be able to read and write normal files, but we also need to be able to support all kinds of "special file" operations. The way to do this, as you're all too familiar with, is abstraction!

We extend the semantics of our previously implemented file manipulation APIs to support arbitrary files (including "special files"):

    int fs_open(const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
    size_t fs_read(int fd, void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t fs_write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t len);
    size_t fs_lseek(int fd, size_t offset, int whence);
    int fs_close(int fd);
    

The extended semantics of this API have a cool name, called [VFS (Virtual File System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system). Since there is a virtual filesystem, there should also be a "real filesystem", where the real filesystem refers to how a certain type of file is manipulated. For example, on Nanos-lite, ordinary files are manipulated through the ramdisk API; on real operating systems, there are countless types of real filesystems: for example, if you're familiar with Windows, you'll know NTFS, which manages ordinary files, and EXT4, which is currently more popular on GNU/Linux; and there are even more types of special files. As for special files, there are many more, so there are `procfs`, `tmpfs`, `devfs`, `sysfs`, `initramfs`... These are different real filesystems, each of which implements a specific way of manipulating these files.

So, VFS is actually an abstraction of different kinds of real file systems, it uses a set of APIs to describe the abstract behavior of these real file systems, blocking the differences between the real file systems, the upper modules (such as system call handler) do not have to care about the current operation of the file is what type, as long as the call to this set of APIs can be completed to the appropriate file operations. With the concept of VFS, it is very easy to add a real file system: just wrap the real file system access method into the VFS API, the upper module does not need to change any code, it can support a new real file system.

#### Here it comes again

When reading the above text, if you think of the concept of AM, you are right, because the idea behind VFS is also abstraction.

In Nanos-lite, the key to implementing VFS is the two read/write function pointers in the `Finfo` structure:

    typedef struct {
      char *name;         // File name
      size_t size;        // File size
      size_t disk_offset;  // File offset in ramdisk
      ReadFn read;        // Read function pointer
      WriteFn write;      // Write function pointer
    } Finfo;
    

Among them, `ReadFn` and `WriteFn` are two kinds of function pointers, which are used to point to the function that actually reads or writes and returns the number of bytes successfully read or written. With these two function pointers, we only need to set up different read/write functions for different files in the file record table, and then we can call the specific read/write functions by `f->read()` and `f->write()`.

#### Simulating Object-Oriented Programming in C

The implementation of VFS shows how to simulate some of the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in C: for example, the definition of a class through a structure, ordinary variables in the structure can be regarded as members of the class, function pointers can be regarded as methods of the class, and different functions can be set to function pointers to realize the overloading of methods...

This suggests that the seemingly nebulous concepts of OOP are no more advanced than in C. It's just that the OOP compiler does more for us, and after compiling into machine code, OOP doesn't exist. [Object-Oriented Programming With ANSI-C](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf) This book is dedicated to simulating OOP concepts and functionality using ANSI-C. There are many places in the GNU/Linux kernel code where OOP is present.

However, in Nanos-lite, since the number of special files is very small, we assume that when the above function pointer is `NULL`, it means that the corresponding file is a normal file, which is read/written by the ramdisk API, so that we don't need to explicitly specify the ramdisk read/write functions for most normal files.

We think of a file as a sequence of bytes, most byte sequences are "static", e.g., for ramdisk and files on disk, if we don't modify them, they will always be located in the same place, such byte sequences have the concept of "location"; but there are some special byte sequences that are not, e.g., byte sequences of typed keys are "flowing", after being read out, such byte sequences will not exist. However, there are some special byte sequences which are not like that, for example, byte sequences typed into a key are "flowing", and after they are read out they don't exist anymore. Files belonging to the former category support the `lseek` operation, and the devices that store them are called "block devices"; files belonging to the latter category do not support the `lseek` operation, and the corresponding devices are called "character devices". Real operating systems also abstract from the `lseek` operation, which we have simplified in Nanos-lite by not implementing it.

### [#](#IOE-for-operating-system) IOE for operating system

With VFS, it is very easy to abstract IOEs into files.

The first place to start is, of course, the simplest output device: the serial port. In Nanos-lite, both `stdout` and `stderr` are output to the serial port. Previously you might have been able to determine whether `sys_write()` writes to the serial port by determining whether `fd` is `1` or `2`. Now with VFS, we don't need to let the system call handler care about these special files: we just need to implement `serial_write()` in `nanos-lite/src/device.c`, and then set up the appropriate write function in the file record table to accomplish the above. Since the serial port is a character device, the corresponding byte sequence has no concept of "position", so the `offset` parameter in `serial_write()` can be ignored. In addition, Nanos-lite is not intended to support `stdin` reads, so it is sufficient to set the error function in the file log table.

#### Abstracting the serial port to a file

Based on the above, let's make the VFS support writing to the serial port.

Regarding the input devices, let's take a look at the clock first. The clock is unique in that most operating systems do not abstract it into a file, but instead provide clock-related system calls for the user program to access. In Nanos-lite, we also provide a `SYS_gettimeofday` system call, which allows the user program to read out the current system time.

#### Implement gettimeofday

Implement the `gettimeofday` system call, please RTFM for the meaning of the parameters of this system call. After implementation, add a new `timer-test` test in `navy-apps/tests/`, and get the current time by `gettimeofday()`, and output a sentence every 0.5 seconds.

In order to better encapsulate the IOE functionality, we provide a multimedia library called NDL (NJU DirectMedia Layer) in Navy. The code for this library is located in `navy-apps/libs/libndl/NDL.c`, but most of the functionality is not implemented. There are a few things in the code related to `NWM_APP` that you can ignore for now, but don't modify the code, as you will experience the functionality at the end of PA4. The NDL provides the user with a clock-related API:

    // Returns the system time in milliseconds
    uint32_t NDL_GetTicks();
    

#### Implementing the NDL clock

You need to implement `NDL_GetTicks()` with `gettimeofday()`, and then modify the `timer-test` test so that it gets the current time by calling `NDL_GetTicks()`. You can add initialization and termination code to `NDL_Init()` and `NDL_Quit()` as needed, and we assume that a program must call `NDL_Init()` before it can use the functions of the NDL library. If you don't think you need to add the initialization code, don't change it.

The other input device is the keyboard, and keystroke information is essentially an event to the system. A simple way to represent events as text is to define the following two types of events,

*   Key press events, e.g. `kd RETURN` for a press of the Enter key
*   Key release events, e.g. `ku A` means release `A` key

Key names are the same as those defined in AM, in all capital letters. In addition, an event is terminated with a line break `\n`.

Our use of text to describe events has two advantages. First, text is obviously a sequence of bytes, which makes it easy to abstract events into files; and text makes it easy for a user program to readably parse the contents of an event. Nanos-lite and Navy assume that such events are abstracted into a special file `/dev/events`, which needs to be readable so that a user program can read out keystrokes from it, but it doesn't need to support `lseek` because it's a character device.

NDL provides the user with an API for keystroke events:

    // Read an event message, write it to `buf`, up to `len` bytes
    // If a valid event is read, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0
    int NDL_PollEvent(char *buf, int len);
    

#### Abstracting keyboard inputs to files

You need to:

*   Implement `events_read()` (defined in `nanos-lite/src/device.c`), which writes events to `buf`, up to `len` bytes, and returns the actual length of the write. The key names are already defined in the string array `names`, you need to use the IOE API to get the device input. In addition, if there is no valid keystroke, then 0 is returned.
*   Add support for `/dev/events` in VFS.
*   Implement `NDL_PollEvent()` in NDL, read events from `/dev/events` and write to `buf`.

We can simplify your implementation by assuming that at most one event will be read out at a time. Once implemented, have Nanos-lite run `navy-apps/tests/event-test`, and if it is implemented correctly, the program will output information about the keystroke event when the key is pressed.

#### Use fopen() or open()?

This is a very interesting question. You need to think about the difference between the behavior of the two APIs, and then analyze which function should be used for the particular file `/dev/events`. We've given some hints in one of the blue boxes.

Finally, there is the VGA, where the program only needs to write pixel information to the VGA's memory in order to update the screen. So, what Nanos-lite needs to do is to abstract the video memory into a file. The memory itself is a piece of storage space that stores the pixels that will be displayed on the screen in a row-first manner. Nanos-lite and Navy assume to abstract the memory to a file `/dev/fb` (fb is a frame buffer), which needs to support write operations and `lseek` to update the pixels to a specified location on the screen.

The NDL provides the user with two APIs related to drawing the screen:

    // Open a (*w) X (*h) canvas
    // If *w and *h are both 0, then the full screen of the system is used as the canvas, and *w and *h are set to the size of the system screen
    void NDL_OpenCanvas(int *w, int *h);
    
    // Draws a `w*h` rectangle to the `(x, y)` coordinates of the canvas, and synchronizes the drawn area to the screen
    // Image pixels are stored in `pixels` in a row-first manner, and each pixel has a 32-bit integer describing the color as `00RRGGBB`
    void NDL_DrawRect(uint32_t *pixels, int x, int y, int w, int h);
    

The "canvas" is a program-oriented concept, the coordinates of the program drawing are set for the canvas, so that the program does not need to care about the size of the system screen, as well as the need to draw the image to where the system screen. NDL can be based on the size of the system screen and the size of the canvas, to determine where to "stick" the canvas, such as to the upper left corner of the screen or center, so that the contents of the canvas will be written to the frame buffer in the correct location.

The functionality of `NDL_DrawRect()` is very similar to the drawing interface introduced in PA2. However, in order to implement it, NDL also needs to know the screen size information. Nanos-lite and Navy have assumed that screen size information is obtained through the `/proc/dispinfo` file, which needs to support read operations. The format of the contents of this file is specified in `navy-apps/README.md`, which you need to read. As for the screen size, you need to get it from the IOE API.

#### Getting Screen Size in NDL

*   Implement `dispinfo_read()` (defined in `nanos-lite/src/device.c`), which writes the `len` bytes of the file to `buf` as per the convention (we assume that this file doesn't support `lseek`, and can ignore `offset`).
*   Read the contents of this file into NDL, parse the screen size from it, and then implement the `NDL_OpenCanvas()` function. Currently `NDL_OpenCanvas()` only needs to record the size of the canvas, but of course we require that the size of the canvas does not exceed the size of the screen.

Let Nanos-lite run `navy-apps/tests/bmp-test`, since it doesn't have drawing capabilities yet, you can't output the image content, but you can first output the parsed screen size via `printf()`.

#### Abstracting VGA frame buffer into a file

*   Initialize the size of `/dev/fb` in the file list in `init_fs()` (defined in `nanos-lite/src/fs.c`).
*   Implement `fb_write()` (defined in `nanos-lite/src/device.c`) to write `len` bytes from `buf` to `offset` on the screen. You need to calculate the coordinates on the screen from `offset`, and then call IOE to draw. In addition, we agree to always synchronize the contents of the frame buffer to the screen immediately after each drawing.
*   Implement `NDL_DrawRect()` in NDL to draw an image by writing pixel information to the correct location in `/dev/fb`. You need to figure out the relationship between the system screen (i.e. the frame buffer), the canvas opened by `NDL_OpenCanvas()`, and the drawing area indicated by `NDL_DrawRect()`.

Let Nanos-lite run `navy-apps/tests/bmp-test`, and if implemented correctly, you will see the Project-N logo displayed on the screen.

#### Implementing a centered canvas

Depending on the screen size and canvas size, you can have NDL draw the image to the center of the screen to get a better visual effect.
